# dkg-metric
Welcome to the official repository for datasets supporting the paper on the Degree of Knowledge Gain (DKG) Metric.

This repository contains the datasets used to validate and analyze the DKG metric, a novel approach for quantifying knowledge acquisition during Web searches. These datasets include annotated search sessions, pre- and post-test results, and data derived from experiments conducted using a specialized legal content platform.

Key Features:
Experiment Data: Includes participant search behaviors, query reformulations, and task completion metrics.
Pre- and Post-Test Results: Used to measure the Transfer of Learning (ToL) and correlate it with the DKG metric.
Annotated Search Logs: Based on the Online Information Searching Strategies (OISS) model and ESKiP taxonomy.
Statistical Insights: Datasets support analyses such as Confidence Interval (CI) and Estimated Power calculations.

Usage:
Researchers and practitioners in information retrieval, learning analytics, and digital education are welcome to use these datasets for further analysis, replication, or extension of the DKG metric research.
