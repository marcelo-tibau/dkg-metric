# dkg-metric
This repository contains datasets used in the study 'The Degree of Knowledge Gain (DKG) metric'. The DKG metric quantifies knowledge acquisition during Web searches by analyzing user interactions, search behaviors, and learning outcomes. These datasets provide the foundation for replicating the study's analysis and extending research in Searching as Learning (SaL). The datasets include:

*1. DKGComputing.csv*
Description: Contains data used to compute the DKG metric for each participant, including query reformulations, clicked documents, and ranking positions.
Key Variables:
- Query terms and similarities
- Clicked document details
- Computed DKG values

*2. SearchMapping.csv*
Description: Provides mappings of search strategies based on the Online Information Searching Strategies (OISS) framework, detailing participants' search behaviors and their association with knowledge gain.
Key Variables:
- Search strategies and codes
- Behavioral observations
- Query classifications

*3. TransferOfLearningScore.csv*
Description: Captures Transfer of Learning (ToL) scores for participants, derived from pre-test and post-test evaluations conducted during the study.
Key Variables:
- Participant IDs
- Pre-test scores
- Post-test scores
- ToL calculations

*How to Use*
These datasets can be used to replicate the studyâ€™s analysis, validate the DKG metric, and explore new research questions related to Web search behavior and learning.
Suggested analyses include calculating DKG values, identifying search behavior patterns, and correlating ToL scores with DKG metrics.
