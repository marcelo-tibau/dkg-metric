# dkg-metric

This repository contains datasets used in the study **"The Degree of Knowledge Gain (DKG) Metric"**. The DKG metric quantifies knowledge acquisition during Web searches by analyzing user interactions, search behaviors, and learning outcomes. These datasets provide the foundation for replicating the study's analysis and extending research in Searching as Learning (SaL).

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets

### 1. **DKGComputing.csv**
- **Description**: Contains data used to compute the DKG metric for each participant, including query reformulations, clicked documents, and ranking positions.
- **Key Variables**:
  - Query terms and similarities
  - Clicked document details
  - Computed DKG values

### 2. **SearchMapping.csv**
- **Description**: Provides mappings of search strategies based on the Online Information Searching Strategies (OISS) framework, detailing participants' search behaviors and their association with knowledge gain.
- **Key Variables**:
  - Search strategies and codes
  - Behavioral observations
  - Query classifications

### 3. **TransferOfLearningScore.csv**
- **Description**: Captures Transfer of Learning (ToL) scores for participants, derived from pre-test and post-test evaluations conducted during the study.
- **Key Variables**:
  - Participant IDs
  - Pre-test scores
  - Post-test scores
  - ToL calculations

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

These datasets can be used to:
- **Replicate the studyâ€™s analysis** to validate findings.
- **Validate the DKG metric** by comparing computed values with other learning measures.
- **Explore new research questions** related to Web search behavior and knowledge acquisition.

### Suggested Analyses
- **Calculate DKG Values**: Use the DKGComputing dataset to replicate or extend the metric computation.
- **Identify Search Behavior Patterns**: Leverage the SearchMapping dataset to explore correlations between search strategies and knowledge gain.
- **Correlate ToL Scores with DKG Metrics**: Analyze relationships between the Transfer of Learning scores and computed DKG values to understand the metric's robustness.

Feel free to use these datasets to advance research in the field of information science and Searching as Learning (SaL).
